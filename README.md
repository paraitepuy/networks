# networks
Graph corporate networks in R, from step 1.

Here you will find examples using [visNetwork](http://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/) to build interactive network visualizations. We will be using networks to investigate corruption, money laundering and illicit trade.

We will learn how to do it by following the numbered R scripts (e.g. "01_graph_...").

You will find the inputs to replicate the examples and the files with how your results will look like in the 'input_output' folder.

If you want to create your own graphs starting a bit ahead, you can go to the scripts starting with "use_template".
