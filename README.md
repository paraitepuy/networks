# networks
Displaying connections between companies, their directors and shareholders is useful when investigating corruption, money laundering or illicit trade. Here you will find examples of interactive visualizations of corporate networks using [visNetwork](http://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/). 

The numbered R scripts (e.g. "01_graph_...") go step by step. All the files to replicate the examples are in the 'input_output' folder. If you want to skip the steps, go to the templates.
