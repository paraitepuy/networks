# networks
Here you will find examples using [visNetwork](http://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/) to build interactive visualizations. Examples will build corporate networks connecting companies and their directors and shareholders to investigate corruption, money laundering and illicit trade.

Follow the numbered R scripts (e.g. "01_graph_...") to go step by step. All the files to replicate the examples are in the 'input_output' folder.

If you want to create your own graphs starting a bit ahead, you can go to the templates and scripts named "use_template".
